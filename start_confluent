Step 1: Identify your shell
Open your Terminal application and run the following command:
bash
echo $0
This will output the name of your shell, typically zsh or bash. 
Step 2: Edit the configuration file 
Based on your shell, open the appropriate configuration file in a text editor like nano. 
For zsh (default on modern macOS): ~/.zshrc
bash
nano ~/.zshrc
For bash: ~/.bash_profile or ~/.bashrc (prefer ~/.bash_profile for login shells)
bash
nano ~/.bash_profile
 
Step 3: Add the environment variables 
In the editor, add the following lines to the end of the file. You may need to adjust the directory path (/usr/local/confluent/) if you installed Confluent Platform in a different location. 
bash
export CONFLUENT_HOME="/usr/local/confluent"
export PATH=$PATH:$CONFLUENT_HOME/bin
Step 4: Save and exit 
Press Control + O to write the changes.
Press Enter to confirm the filename.
Press Control + X to exit the nano editor. 
Step 5: Apply the changes
For the changes to take effect immediately in your current terminal session, source the configuration file: 
For zsh:
bash
source ~/.zshrc
